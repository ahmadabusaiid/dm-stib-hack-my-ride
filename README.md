## Project Instructions

Since you study in ULB, you must be a regular user of stib-mivb - the
company providing public transport in Brussels. This already makes you a
domain expert in this data challenge.

News: stib-mivb has an [open data portal](https://stibmivb.opendatasoft.com/pages/home/), on which the scheduling of the
trips as well as the real-time vehicle arrival times are continuously
published.

We have collected about 3 weeks of this data for you:
- The location of all vehicles every +-30 seconds, encoded in JSON.
The JSON format is described at the end of this document
- Esri Shape files describing the map (lines and stops) of stib-mivb
network, 23 September
- GTFS files containing the offline plan/schedule covering the same
period of the vehicle location data, two snapshots 3 September and
23 September

One major concern for public transport is the satisfaction of passengers. In
stib-mivb this is translated into punctuality and regularity of vehicle arrival
times at stops. Punctuality is when the vehicle arrives at the stop in the
time which is scheduled, as in the GTFS file. Note that the GTFS is
encoding the schedule information which is printed on paper at the stops.
For frequent lines, i.e., where the headway is lower than 12min, regularity
is more relevant as a quantification of QoS than punctuality. For these lines,
passengers tend to go to the stop without looking at the exact arrival times,
as they know that they will have a maximum wait of a few minutes. For
these lines, the goal is to analyze whether the vehicles indeed arrive in the
planned headway, rather than analyzing their exact arrival times. Notice
that the planned headway per line changes depends on the hour of day. In
peak hours, for instance, the headway will be smallest. In early and late
night hours, the headway will be largest.

A quantitative measure that captures regularity is the EWT - Excess
Waiting Time. A brief description of it can be found 
[here](https://www.trapezegroup.com.au/resources/infographic-how-to-calculate-excess-waiting-time/), and you can
yourself find many other resources explaining it. In your analysis, you can
use this measure, and there is no restriction to use other measures if you
find better.

#### Objectives
Your team is challenged to analyze the given data, and provide quantitative
insights about the quality of service. This overall all challenge is broken in
the following tasks:
1. Distinguish the lines/periods/day/timegroups for which the QoS is
assessed by punctuality, and those assessed by regularity.
2. Analyze the punctuality over the different lines, stops, and calendar
days.
3. Analyze the regularity over the different lines, stops, and timegroups.
Notice that, as a prerequisite to this analysis, you will probably need to
identify the timegroups of different regularity per line, as explained
during the lecture. If you find another way, you have all the freedom to
apply your method.
4. In some cases, there are problematic segments that cause big delays or
irregularity (bottlenecks). This delay / irregularity will then propagate to
the rest of the line. Identify these lines/segments, and analyze if there is
a pattern.
5. Think your own of a valuable analysis on this data

#### Deliverables
You should deliver a presentation of your work and results (as a .pdf)
containing the following elements:
1. A cover page with the list of group members, including student ID
2. A description of dataset loading and preprocessing
3. A description of your data exploration activity; better accompanied
with statistics, figures, screenshots, etc
4. A clear presentation of your solution (idea/algorithm) for every task.
Special attention should be given to the correctness of the results
5. An interactive dashboard for visualizing the QoS KPIs that you extract
in all the analysis tasks. The dashboard should be thought of to allow
STIB data teams to visualize your analysis results of all the tasks 1-5,
to visualize for certain lines, stops, neighborhoods, time periods, etc.

#### Evaluation
The evaluation jury consists of the two course instructors. STIB-MIVB
representatives will also attend, depending on their availability. You will be
asked to present your solution and defend it. The grading will consider the
following factors:
- Your data management: loading, integration, exploration (5 points)
- For every analysis task (5 points each):
    - Your justification for the analysis pipeline and the parameter setting
    - Your presentation and interpretation of the results
- Your validation/evaluation of the obtained results in every task. Think
of answers to questions like: how far are your results accurate? have
you cross checked your results with some ground truth? What would
limit the use of your solution in stib-mivb (5 points)
